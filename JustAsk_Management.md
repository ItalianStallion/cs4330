## Vision
For this application, we wanted to make a simple, easy-to-use rsvp app that lets users quickly respond to invitations and events. Everyone on our team uses some sort of third-party communication application such as GroupMe or Slack, but we wanted to implement an app that simplifies some core ideas even further. Our application will be a simplified invitation/questionaire app to quickly receive feedback from friends. In the future, we may implement a polling feature such as StrawPoll to expand on our easy answer approach.

---

## Configuration Management Plan
Our team will be using multiple resources to manage and work on our application. Github will be used to store and keep track of the version history of all of our documents, including the most up-to-date version of our app. We will also be using Google Drive as a document editing tool where we can all be working on the same document in real time and giving feedback to each other. For communication purposes, outside of meetings, we will be using GroupMe.

---

## Process Model
Considering the short time frame our team has to complete this project and the inexperience of our team in Android Development, we will be focusing on agile development as our process model. We want to be able to produce the software relatively quickly and have the ability to go back in our work and change things on the fly as we spot mistakes. Also, there is no real liability risk with this application, so a focus on safety is not our main priority. The agile method works with the time table and experience of our team more than any other model.

---

## Deliverables
Our application only has one deliverable and that is the executable app that the user can download from the Google Play store.

---

## Potential Risks
For risks, we designed our application with simplicity in mind, to minimize the amount of risks concerning resources and time. That being said, our team is fairly inexperienced using Android Studio and designing mobile applications, so developing this app may pose some risks concerning implementation. The application poses no threat to humans or liability as its simply an rsvp application. All risks involved with the app go hand in hand with having a mobile device in the first place. There are other means of communication and users are not expected to rely solely on our app for communication.

## Team Members
**Miles Vesper** - I worked on every document that was turned in for a grade, but mostly on the management document. With the application, I mainly focused on the notification implementation as well as integration with Facebook. Lastly, I created most of the slideshow presentation.

**John Edward Schwartzenburg** - In the beginning, I came up with our app idea.  However, liability concerns led us to adjust the app idea slightly to what it is now. I contributed to the majority of the documents that we're submitted for grading. Lastly, I was responsible for integrating our app with Facebook.

**Patrick Mancuso** - I was also present and worked on all the documentation. As for the application I focused mainly on designing the layouts as well as assisting Ben with the backend and database structure. Most of my work on the app was done as pair programming. Since I've never used Android Studios before we found that I would be able to contribute more and learn quicker by working with a more experienced partner.

**Ben Graham** - Having a more experienced background in Android development, I developed and oversaw many of the feature implementations and layout designs discussed in meetings and our documentation. I was also responsible for designing the backend with the help of Patrick and integrating it with Facebook thanks to John.

*Because of the inexperience of the majority of our team with application development, we have decided to adopt the egoless approach for our team management. Everyone will be equally responsible for the features of the application and must work together as equals for the implementation of features.*

## Project Schedule 
Below is a *very* rough estimation of the development of our application, as we do not know the specifics of developing in Android Studio.

|Task|Start Date|Time Spent|End Date|
|----|----------|----------|-------:|
|Set up the Project in Studio with a basic activity|10/20/16|1 week|10/27/16|
|Set up the backend of the application using Google Firebase|10/27/16|2 weeks|11/10/16|
|Connect the application to Facebook with login system|10/27/16|2 weeks|11/10/16|
|Implement Interface Design|10/27/16|1 week|11/3/16|
|Connect User's friends on Facebook to them on JustAsk|11/3/16|1 week|11/10/16|
|Implement Question-asking feature|11/10/16|2 weeks|11/24/16|

Using this rough estimate, we were able to make the following Gantt Chart.

## Meeting Summary
|Meeting Time|Members Present|Objective/Outcome|
|------|---------------|-------------------------|
|9/5/16|All Group Members Present|Meeting to discuss system ideas and presentation. We decided to make a notification application that allows people to check in on others with a simple notification to the recipient's phone|
|10/12/16|All Group Members Present|Goal was to discuss the software requirements document. We decided that our check in idea would not be an ideal app due to liability risks, so we adapted the idea into an rsvp application for creating and receiving simple yes/no questions|
|10/19/16|All Group Members Present|Meeting to work on the Requirements Document and polish it up for grading|
|10/31/16|All Group Members Present|Goal for this meeting was to discuss and begin working on the system design document. Individual Members were to work on certain sections in Google Docs and put the complete document on Github when finished|
|11/21/16|All Group Members Present|The testing document was due tonight, so the team met to discuss all possible testing paths to produce a complete testing document|
|11/27/16|All Group Members but Sam Dowd|Discuss the design of the powerpoint presentation and practice the presentation|
|11/28/16|All Group Members but Sam Dowd|Reviewed the powerpoint and practiced presentation|
