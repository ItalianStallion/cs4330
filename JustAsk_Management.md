## Vision
For this application, we wanted to make a simple, easy-to-use rsvp app that lets users quickly respond to invitations and events. Everyone on our team uses some sort of third-party communication application such as groupme or slack, but we wanted to implement an app that simplifies some core ideas even further. Our application will be a simplified invitation/questionaire app to quickly receive feedback from friends. In the future, we may implement a polling feature such as StrawPoll to expand on our easy answer approach.

---

## Configuration Management Plan
Our team will be using multiple resources to manage and work on our application. Github will be used to store and keep track of the version history of all of our documents, including the most up-to-date version of our app. We will also be using Google Drive as a document editing tool where we can all be working on the same document in real time and giving feedback to each other. For communication purposes, outside of meetings, we will be using Groupme.

## Process Model

---

## Deliverables
Our application only has one deliverable and that is the executable app that the use can download from the Google Play store.

---

## Potential Risks
For risks, we designed our application with simplicity in mind, to minimize the amount of risks concerning resources and time. That being said, our team is fairly inexperienced using Android Studio and designing mobile applications, so developing this app may pose some risks concerning implementation. The application poses no threat to humans or liability as its simply an rsvp application. All risks involved with the app go hand in hand with having a mobile device in the first place. There are other means of communication and users are not expected to rely solely on our app for communication.

## Team Members
Benjamin Graham: Tasks include but not limited to design of the backend database due to his experience with Google's Firebase API.

Sam Dowd and Patrick Mancuso: Their tasks include designing the layout and functionality of the application pages. Switching between pages is also an important task, as our application will be focused on ease-of-use.

Miles Vesper and John Edward Schwartzenburg: tasks will focus on the login system using Facebook and the push notifications for questions.

Because of the inexperience of our team with application development, we have decided to adopt the egoless approach for our team management. Everyone will be equally responsible for the features of the application and must work together as equals for the implementation of features.

## Project Schedule 
Below is a *very* rough estimation of the development of our application, as we do not know the specifics of developing in Android Studio.

|Task|Start Date|Time Spent|End Date|
|----|----------|----------|-------:|
|Set up the Project in Studio with a basic activity|10/20/16|1 week|10/27/16|
|Set up the backend of the application using Google Firebase|10/27/16|2 weeks|11/10/16|
|Connect the application to Facebook with login system|10/27/16|2 weeks|11/10/16|
|Implement Interface Design|10/27/16|1 week|11/3/16|
|Connect User's friends on Facebook to them on JustAsk|11/3/16|1 week|11/10/16|
|Implement Question-asking feature|11/10/16|2 weeks|11/24/16|

Using this rough estimate, we were able to make the following Gantt Chart.

## Meeting Summary
|Meeting Time|Members Present|Objective/Outcome|
|------|---------------|-------------------------|
|9/5/16|All Group Members Present|Meeting to discuss system ideas and presentation. We decided to make a notification application that allows people to check in on others with a simple notification to the receipients phone|
|10/12/16|All Group Members Present|Goal was to discuss the software requirements document. We decided that our check in idea would not be an ideal app due to liability risks, so we adapted the idea into an rsvp application for creating and receiving simple yes/no questions|
|10/19/16|All Group Members Present|Meeting to work on the Requirements Document and polish it up for grading|
|10/31/16|All Group Members Present|Goal for this meeting was to discuss and begin working on the system design document. Individual Members were to work on certain sections in Google Docs and put the complete document on Github when finished|
|11/21/16|All Group Members Present|The testing document was due tonight, so the team met to discuss all possible testing paths to produce a complete testing document|
