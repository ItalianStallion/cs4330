## Vision
For this application, we wanted to make a simple, easy-to-use rsvp app that lets users quickly respond to invitations and events. Everyone on our team uses some sort of third-party communication application such as groupme or slack, but we wanted to implement an app that simplifies some core ideas even further. Our application will be a simplified invitation/questionaire app to quickly receive feedback from friends. In the future, we may implement a polling feature such as StrawPoll to expand on our easy answer approach.

## Potential Risks
For risks, we designed our application with simplicity in mind, to minimize the amount of risks concerning resources and time. That being said, our team is fairly inexperienced using Android Studio and designing mobile applications, so developing this app may pose some risks concerning implementation. The application poses no threat to humans or liability as its simply an rsvp application. All risks involved with the app go hand in hand with having a mobile device in the first place. There are other means of communication and users are not expected to rely solely on our app for communication.
