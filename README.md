### JustAsk is a question asking app for Android devices. Users can ask yes or no questions to a large group of their friends and gather responses quickly!

Currently the market is filled with options that provide calendar events and planning, but most of these choices seem too formal for daily meetups often requiring dates, times, locations, guest lists, cover photos, etc. Sometimes all you want to know is ARE YOU FREE FOR LUNCH? YES OR NO. JustAsk lets you organize these questions and responses in one place without the hassle of group messaging and event creation. Users can respond to these questions directly from their lock screen notifications or from within the app, and see everyone else's replies as well, making informal group events much quicker and more enjoyable to plan.
